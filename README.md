# NextJS Authentication Application

Welcome to the NextJS Authentication Application! This application is designed to provide user registration, login, profile management, and password recovery functionalities. It is built on Next.js, with a sleek design created using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. The application leverages MongoDB for data storage, bcryptjs for password encryption, Nodemailer for sending verification emails, and Jsonwebtoken for secure authentication.

## Features

- **User Registration:**
  - Collects user information such as username, email, and password.
  - Encrypts passwords using bcryptjs.
  - Stores additional fields like `isVerified` (to check email verification status), `isAdmin` (to identify admin users), `verifyToken`, `forgotPasswordToken` and their expiry date in MongoDB.

- **Email Verification:**
  - Sends verification emails using Nodemailer and Mailtrap.io.
  - Users receive an email with a link containing a verification token.
  - Clicking the link verifies the email and sets `isVerified` to true in the database.

- **Login:**
  - Users can log in only if their email is verified.
  - Generates a Jsonwebtoken upon successful login, storing it in cookies.
  - The user remains logged in until the token expires.

- **Profile Page:**
  - After logging in, users are directed to a profile page.
  - Includes "Get Details" and "Logout" buttons.
  - "Get Details" fetches and displays the username, email, and user ID.
  - "Logout" erases the stored web token, logging the user out.

- **Forgot Password:**
  - Provides a forgot password option on the login page.
  - Users submit their registered email.
  - Receives a password reset email with a token-embedded link.
  - Clicking the link directs users to a page to enter a new password.
  - Verifies the token and updates the encrypted new password in the database.
